## Development

This application utilizes a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema. The routes are handled using Express.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Usage

When the user loads the page, they are given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user is able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.

## Deployment

This application is deployed with a MongoDB database to Heroku.

## Future Development

Future development for this application includes a profile page, which will allow users to view their own workouts, as well as share them with other users. Users will be able to share their profiles and workouts, utilizing public and private posting features.
